Interactive Logarithm-Exponential Conversion Reference Guide 📚
Chapter 1: Understanding the Fundamental Relationship
What Are Logarithms? 🔍
A logarithm is fundamentally the inverse operation of exponentiation. When we write log₂(8) = 3, we are asking: "To what power must we raise 2 to get 8?" The answer is 3, because 2³ = 8.

Key Definition Box 📋

Logarithm: The logarithm of a number to a given base is the exponent to which the base must be raised to produce that number.

Mathematical Notation: log_b(x) = y if and only if b^y = x

The Inverse Relationship Explained ⚖️
Exponential and logarithmic functions are inverse operations, meaning they "undo" each other. This relationship is similar to how addition and subtraction are inverses, or multiplication and division.

Visual Representation:

Exponential Form	⟷	Logarithmic Form
2³ = 8	⟷	log₂(8) = 3
5² = 25	⟷	log₅(25) = 2
10⁴ = 10,000	⟷	log₁₀(10,000) = 4

Converting from Exponential to Logarithmic Form
Process Steps:

Identify the base (the number being raised to a power)
Identify the exponent (the power)
Identify the result (what the base raised to the exponent equals)
Rewrite using logarithmic notation

Converting from Logarithmic to Exponential Form
Process Steps:

Identify the argument (the number inside the logarithm)
Identify the logarithm value (what the logarithm equals)
Rewrite using exponential notation
Example 1: Convert log₅(125) = 3 to exponential form

Logarithm Value: 6
Exponential Form: 2⁶ = 64
Chapter 3: Evaluating Simple Logarithmic Expressions 🧮
Mental Calculation Strategies
Strategy 1: Perfect Power Recognition

When the argument is a perfect power of the base, use mental math:

log₂(16) = ? → Think: "2 to what power equals 16?" → 2⁴ = 16, so log₂(16) = 4
log₃(27) = ? → Think: "3 to what power equals 27?" → 3³ = 27, so log₃(27) = 3
Strategy 2: Using Known Powers

Build a mental library of common powers:

Base 2 Powers	Base 3 Powers	Base 10 Powers
2¹ = 2	3¹ = 3	10¹ = 10
2² = 4	3² = 9	10² = 100
2³ = 8	3³ = 27	10³ = 1,000
2⁴ = 16	3⁴ = 81	10⁴ = 10,000
Technology-Assisted Evaluation 💻
For non-perfect powers, use scientific calculators:

Calculator Steps for log₃(29):

Enter: log(29) ÷ log(3)
Result: ≈ 3.065
Margin Note 📝

Most calculators only have log₁₀ and ln (natural log) buttons. Use the change of base formula: log_b(x) = log(x)/log(b)

Earthquake Measurements: The Richter Scale 🌍
The Richter scale uses logarithms base 10 to measure earthquake intensity. Each whole number increase represents a 10-fold increase in amplitude.

Canadian Example: The 1988 Saguenay earthquake in Quebec measured 5.9 on the Richter scale.

Mathematical Representation: If the amplitude is A, then Richter magnitude M = log₁₀(A/A₀), where A₀ is a reference amplitude.

Practice Problem: If an earthquake has an amplitude 1,000 times greater than the reference, what is its Richter magnitude?

Solution: M = log₁₀(1000) = log₁₀(10³) = 3

Sound Intensity: Decibel Measurements 🔊
Sound intensity is measured in decibels using logarithmic scales.

Formula: dB = 10 × log₁₀(I/I₀)

Canadian Context Examples:

Whisper: ~30 dB
Normal conversation: ~60 dB
Toronto traffic: ~80 dB
Rock concert: ~110 dB
