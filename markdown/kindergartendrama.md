🎭 Our Bodies Tell Stories: Kindergarten Drama Guide 🎭
📖 Welcome to Movement Magic! 📖
Hello, young storytellers! Did you know that your body can tell amazing stories without saying a single word? Today we're going to learn how to use our whole body to show feelings, act like different characters, and have fun with our friends!

🌟 What is Body Language? 🌟
Body language is how we use our body to show what we're thinking or feeling. It's like having a conversation without talking!

Your Body Parts Are Story Tools:
👀 Eyes - Can look happy, sad, or surprised
😊 Face - Shows all your feelings
🙌 Arms - Can reach up high or hug tight
🦵 Legs - Help you walk, run, or dance
🤲 Hands - Point, wave, and gesture

👫 Playing Mirror Games 👫
Mirror games help us learn from our friends and practice our movements!

How to Play Mirror Magic:
Find a partner and stand facing each other
One person is the leader - they make slow movements
The other person is the mirror - they copy exactly what they see
Take turns being the leader and the mirror
Be gentle and kind to help your friend learn
Fun Mirror Ideas:
🌊 Wave your arms like ocean waves
🌳 Sway side to side like trees in the wind
⭐ Reach up high like you're touching stars
🐸 Hop up and down like a happy frog
